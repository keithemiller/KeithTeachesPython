  "body": "### Welcome to Keith Teaches Python\r\nThis is an introductory overview of Python, but what is Python? Python refers to \"CPython\" which is a version of the Python interpreter built in C. Some other implementations include Jython which is built in Java and IronPython which is built in C#. Also, there is in fact a difference between certain versions of Python. Python3 and Python2 have some key differences in how they were built. Today, when I say Python, I mean Python2 (most specifically CPython2.7.X) not Python3. Python3 is much newer, but Python2 is still dominant. \r\n\r\n## Pre-Workshop Setup\r\nWe will be going over key features of using Python for scientific computing using the Anaconda Python distribution. \r\n\r\nPlease **download and install Python2.7**: <a href=\"https://www.continuum.io/downloads\">Anaconda Downloads</a>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKeith Miller (@keithemiller)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed help? Something broken? Shoot me an email at keithmiller@umass.edu\r\n",
